*Snake Game
This project is a modern recreation of the classic Snake game built in C++ using the SDL2 library. It demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as inheritance, polymorphism, and event-driven design.

*Features
Gameplay: Control a snake that grows longer with each piece of food it eats.
Objective: Avoid collisions with the snake’s body or the screen edges.
SDL2: Handles real-time inputs, graphical rendering, and game updates.
